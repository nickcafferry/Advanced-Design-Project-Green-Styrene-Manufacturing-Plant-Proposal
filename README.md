Bentham Coporation requires the production of 100,000 te y-1 of styrene monomer at purity of 99.7 mol%. (See [Project Specification](https://github.com/nickcafferry/Advanced-Design-Project-Green-Styrene-Manufacturing-Plant-Proposal/tree/master/Project%20Specification) for more details)

Syteren is a monomer used in the production of polymers including polystrene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and styrene-butadiene (SBR). Following fluctuations in the price of polystyrene the board would like a recommendation on which polymer should be produced from the styrene monomer.

### Appraise

#### Summary
The aim of this plant design project is to provide critical insights into and recommendations of the available synthetic routes to styrene along with market, feedstock, economic, and sustainability analyses of the venture. This has culminated in a preliminary overview of the plant design and operation in the area of Ordos, China, produced for our clients at Bentham Corporation. 

### Define-Phase

#### Summary
The purpose of this report is to find the optimal dimensions and the optimal operating variables of two dehydrogenation reactors. More specifically, the height and diameter, catalyst amount and characteristics, heat exchange strategy of reactors need to be determined optimally. The operating conditions include temperature and pressure as well as the steam-to-ethylbenzene ratio.

### Layout-Phase

#### Summary 
This study is to predict safe separation distances via accident consequence modelling of various accidental failure scenarios for hazardous units relevant with ethylene gas dispersion, so as to modify the plant layout accordingly to guarantee safety of personnel in on-site buildings and reduce risks to acceptable level for the population outside the plant, and prevent, limit and mitigate domino effects as much as possible.
