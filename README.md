## Project-Description

### Appraise

#### Summary
The aim of this plant design project is to provide critical insights into and recommendations of the available synthetic routes to styrene along with market, feedstock, economic, and sustainability analyses of the venture. This has culminated in a preliminary overview of the plant design and operation in the area of Ordos, China, produced for our clients at Bentham Corporation. 

### Define Phase

#### Summary
* The purpose of this report is to find the optimal dimensions and the optimal operating variables of two dehydrogenation reactors. More specifically, the height and diameter, catalyst amount and characteristics, heat exchange strategy of reactors need to be determined optimally. The operating conditions include temperature and pressure as well as the steam-to-ethylbenzene ratio.
* To begin, the design problem has been outlined and general explanations are given for the presence of the dehydrogenation unit. Specifications, such as single-pass conversion of ethylbenzene and selectivity to styrene have been made quite clear. The details of all inputs and outputs of the dehydrogenation reactors, including operating conditions, are demonstrated in figures and tables. Also, a block diagram of the unit has been used as a visual representation of the process. Some fundamental high-level decisions, such as reaction sequences, reactor selection and the type of catalyst, are made with justifications. 
* Moreover, the design methodology of two reactors is described in details. The design equations including differential mass balances, energy balances and momentum balances are proposed to construct the mathematical model. In this report, the heterogeneous model is employed to include both thermal reactions and catalyst reactions. Since adiabatic reactors are used for the process, there is no external heat transfer for the individual unit and therefore, the heat transfer resistance can be neglected. As to mass transfer resistance, calculations demonstrate that it is also negligible. For the sensitivity of design, the general description of methods has been given. 
* Furthermore, Wolfram Mathematica 11.1 has been utilised to generate the computational solutions of the design equations as well as parametric studies. The key variable profiles, including concentration, pressure, temperature and conversion and selectivity as well, are presented in this report. Also, results are outlined and used to improve process design. And based on control scheme and fault tree analysis, some suggestions are proposed for the design.

### Layout-Phase

#### Summary 
This study is to predict safe separation distances via accident consequence modelling of various accidental failure scenarios for hazardous units relevant with ethylene gas dispersion, so as to modify the plant layout accordingly to guarantee safety of personnel in on-site buildings and reduce risks to acceptable level for the population outside the plant, and prevent, limit and mitigate domino effects as much as possible.
