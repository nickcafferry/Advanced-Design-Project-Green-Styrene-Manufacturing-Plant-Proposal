Material and Enthalpy Balance
==============================

The material balance and energy balance for styrene production was developed based on the BFD shown in Figure 1.

Material Balance
-----------------

The assumptions used for the mass balance is listed in Table 2. It was given that the desired annual production rate of ST is 100,000
te/year. This can be converted to = 99,700∗106 8,000∗3,600∗104.15 = 33.239 With reaction stoichiometry and assumptions given
above, we can employ back-propagating method to solve the material balances for each unit. Table 3. and Table 4. gives details of
reaction information within dehydrogenation reactor, alkylation reactor and transalkylation reactor, respectively. Based on
assumptions 6, 8, 9 and the correlation between conversion and recycle stream30, the flowrates of total pure EB stream, the recycled
EB stream and steam can be easily calculated. Similarly, with assumptions 1, 2 and 3, 4 and 5, the recycle BZ stream to alkylator,
transalkylator and the recycle DEB stream to transalkylator can be treated with the same technique. The final result of flowrates
(mol/s) of all the streams has been presented in Table 5.


Enthalpy Balance
----------------

A list of assumptions has been given in Table 6. Due to the fact that there is no shaft work, the energy balance in terms of conversion
can be written in a simple form as follows:


Table 7 provides the details of properties of relevant chemical components and Table 8 gives the heat of reaction at the mean
temperature of the first dehydrogenation reactor. Hence,


We are told to use the demineralised water as raw material to produce steam with furnace instead of using steam directly.
Therefore, for the second term FA0 ∑n i=1 ΘiĈ pi(Ti − Ti0), it is still not difficult to find that FA0 ∑n i=1 ΘiĈ pi(Ti − Ti0) =
16392.386.

Therefore, it is necessary to add a furnace and its heat duty is = 20.342
