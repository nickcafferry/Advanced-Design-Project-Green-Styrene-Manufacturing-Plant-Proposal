GSM co. recognises its corporate responsibility to protect the environment and conserve precious natural resources. The company
closely follows the European Industrial Emissions Directive (2010) as well as the DEFRA Environmental Permitting Regulations
(2010) from UK legislation. During plant construction and commissioning, great care is taken to ensure the plant is situated in an
area which allows minimisation of the environmental impact of our operations. As a company, we are committed to reducing our
carbon footprint and we ensure all feedstocks, inventories and products/byproducts of our processes are stored, transported and
disposed of safely and in accordance with the above legislation.

Energy integration is maximised when designing processes in order to minimise energy consumption and our plant projects are also
planned using principles of inherently safe design and passive hazard protection, which reduces the likelihood of occurrence and
overall environmental impact of inventory releases, explosions and fires. We also employ recycle streams in process design, use
waste products as fuels and find buyers for byproducts/waste effluent streams from our processes wherever economically viable to
do so; thereby reducing waste and reducing the consumption of raw materials
