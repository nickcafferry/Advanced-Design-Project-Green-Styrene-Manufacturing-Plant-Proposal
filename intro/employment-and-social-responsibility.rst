GSM is committed to attracting, retaining and developing a diverse workforce. When recruiting, GSM co. never discriminates on the basis of 
gender, age, race, nationality or religion. Regardless of background, all of our employees will have the opportunity to develop their talents 
and maximise their potential - all while working in an inclusive, meritocratic environment and being recognised and fairly rewarded for their 
efforts. GSM incorporates positive discrimination when recruiting and promoting employees, including ensuring at least one BAME/disabled and 
one female candidate is interviewed for each position.

GSM adheres to the Equality Act of 2010, which covers workplace bullying and harassment. All employees have access to HR representatives within 
the company should they need to make a complaint and employees found guilty of harassment in the workplace will face punitive action; multiple 
offences will lead to automatic dismissal.

All of our employees are expected to co-operate with the GSM management on H&S matters, use due diligence and take reasonable care when performing
tasks at work, use all safety measures built into process units/plant to minimise risks/eliminate hazards and wear all PPE provided by the company.
Employees are encouraged to take periodic rest breaks during the day to maintain performance and concentration levels and to always express any 
concerns about H&S policy or systems of work to their allocated H&S representative.

GSM often employs plant workers from the local region, especially in developing economies. All employees at GSM (no matter the region) are provided
with a competitive salary and the high standard of employment rights/protections enshrined in UK law - including leave and sick pay. Additionally, 
a percentage of profits from our business activities will be reinvested into the GSM community development fund; which will provide funding for 
construction of schools, hospitals and homes etc. which will directly benefit local employees and their wider community.
