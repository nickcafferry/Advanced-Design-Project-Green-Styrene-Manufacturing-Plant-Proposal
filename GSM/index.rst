Company Ethics and Values
=========================

As a trans-national chemical contracting company operating in a complex and ever-changing world, GSM chemical co. is committed to adhering to the
highest of global standards of performance and ethical corporate conduct.The key ethical principles which underpin day-to-day running and company 
policy of GSM include; Risk management and reduction, professionalism and competence, trust, obligation and liability, organisation and clear 
communication, regular auditing/review, active whistleblowing, industry regulations, legislation and national/international law, avoidance of 
conflict of interests as well as social and environmental corporate responsibilities.

Safety Management
================
GSM goes above and beyond to ensure the safety of its employees, contractors as well as others affected by its business activities. GSM, as a UK 
registered company, follows IEE & CDM regulations and the UK Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) with a particular focus on S2, S3 and S6 of the 
act; these ensure health and safety of workers, contractors and members of the public is safeguarded. All process equipment is regularly inspected 
(at minimum biannually) to ensure any faults are repaired/parts replaced and the plant operates safely during start-up, shutdown, normal operation 
and, so far as reasonably practicable (SFARP) during ‘abnormal operations’.

Employment and Social Responsibility
====================================

GSM co. recognises its corporate responsibility to protect the environment and conserve precious natural resources. The company closely follows the 
European Industrial Emissions Directive (2010) as well as the DEFRA Environmental Permitting Regulations (2010) from UK legislation. During plant
construction and commissioning, great care is taken to ensure the plant is situated in an area which allows minimisation of the environmental impact 
of our operations. As a company, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and we ensure all feedstocks, inventories and products/byproducts
of our processes are stored, transported and disposed of safely and in accordance with the above legislation.

Energy integration is maximised when designing processes in order to minimise energy consumption and our plant projects are also planned using 
principles of inherently safe design and passive hazard protection, which reduces the likelihood of occurrence and overall environmental impact of 
inventory releases, explosions and fires. We also employ recycle streams in process design, use waste products as fuels and find buyers for byproducts/waste 
effluent streams from our processes wherever economically viable to do so; thereby reducing waste and reducing the consumption of raw materials.
