### Ethics-and-Values
The key ethical principles which underpin day-to-day running and company policy of GSM include：Risk management and reduction, professionalism and competence, trust, obligation and liability, organisation and clear communication, regular auditing/review, active whistleblowing, industry regulations, legislation and national/international law, avoidance of conflict of interests as well as social and environmental corporate responsibilities.

### Safety-Management
GSM, as a UK registered company, follows IEE & CDM regulations and the UK Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) with a particular focus on S2, S3 and S6 of the act; these ensure health and safety of workers, contractors and members of the public is safeguarded. All process equipment is regularly inspected (at minimum biannually) to ensure any faults are repaired/parts replaced and the plant operates safely during start-up, shutdown, normal operation and, so far as reasonably practicable (SFARP) during ‘abnormal operations’.

GSM organises for H&S according to the 4C’s: **CONTROL** - clear safety directives, communicated clearly to the ‘hands’ of the organisation from upper management, ensuring personnel understand individual responsibilities and accountabilities; **COOPERATION** - planning of H&S measures involving workers, management and safety reps, including development of safe systems of work; **COMMUNICATION** - regular provision of safety information and updates to employees and channels for all employees to voice concerns about safety policy; **COMPETANCY** - all staff and contractors adequately trained and qualified to ensure job roles can be performed safely.

### Employment-and-Social-Responsibility
GSM is committed to attracting, retaining and developing a diverse workforce. When recruiting, GSM co. never discriminates on the basis of gender, age, race, nationality or religion. Regardless of background, all of our employees will have the opportunity to develop their talents and maximise their potential - all while working in an inclusive, meritocratic environment and being recognised and fairly rewarded for their efforts. GSM incorporates positive discrimination when recruiting and promoting employees, including ensuring at least one BAME/disabled and one female candidate is interviewed for each position. GSM adheres to the Equality Act of 2010, which covers workplace bullying and harassment. All employees have access to HR representatives within the company should they need to make a complaint and employees found guilty of harassment in the
workplace will face punitive action; multiple offences will lead to automatic dismissal.

### Environmental-Responsibility
GSM co. recognises its corporate responsibility to protect the environment and conserve precious natural resources. The company closely follows the European Industrial Emissions Directive (2010) as well as the DEFRA Environmental Permitting Regulations (2010) from UK legislation. During plant construction and commissioning, great care is taken to ensure the plant is situated in an area which allows minimisation of the environmental impact of our operations. As a company, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and we ensure all feedstocks, inventories and products/byproducts of our processes are stored, transported and disposed of safely and in accordance with the above legislation.
