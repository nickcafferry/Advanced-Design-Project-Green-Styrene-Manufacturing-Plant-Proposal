Thermodynamic Limitations and Side reactions
--------------------------------------------

The first step in the production of commercial EB is the reversible reaction between benzene and ethylene forming EB.

EB can react further to form polyethylbenzenes (PEBS) such di-ethylbenzenes (DEBs) and Tri-ethylbenzenes (TEBs). An excess
of benzene is typically used to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium to the right-hand side, thereby limiting the available ethylene
for further alkylation to PEBs. In addition to transalkylation, isomerization and polymerization may occur producing xylenes and
oligomers; these side reactions occur at negligibly low rates because modern industrial catalysts are highly selective for
monoalkylation and seldom partake in these side reactions. Alkylation catalysts will be discussed later on in SECTION 2.2.2. To
further increase conversion of ethylbenzene, polyethylbenzenes are transalkylated to EB via a transalkylation process:
