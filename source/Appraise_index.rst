Thermodynamic Limitations and Side reactions
--------------------------------------------

The first step in the production of commercial EB is the reversible reaction between benzene and ethylene forming EB.

EB can react further to form polyethylbenzenes (PEBS) such di-ethylbenzenes (DEBs) and Tri-ethylbenzenes (TEBs). An excess
of benzene is typically used to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium to the right-hand side, thereby limiting the available ethylene
for further alkylation to PEBs. In addition to transalkylation, isomerization and polymerization may occur producing xylenes and
oligomers; these side reactions occur at negligibly low rates because modern industrial catalysts are highly selective for
monoalkylation and seldom partake in these side reactions. Alkylation catalysts will be discussed later on in SECTION 2.2.2. To
further increase conversion of ethylbenzene, polyethylbenzenes are transalkylated to EB via a transalkylation process:

This reaction should also be done in the presence of excess benzene to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium to the right and increase
conversion of PEB. Although alkylation and transalkylation can be carried out in the same reactor, higher EB yield and purity are
achieved with a separate alkylator and transalkylator, operating under different conditions optimized for the respective reactions.
EB production with 2 separate reactors is optimal for the highest possible yield of EB. Due to the thermodynamic limitations as
described above, benzene excess dictates, in both alkylation and transalkylation reactors, the conversion of EB1,3,4,5,6. Having too
much benzene excess, however, leads to a large benzene recycle flowrate, increasing feedstock, capital, and operating costs.
