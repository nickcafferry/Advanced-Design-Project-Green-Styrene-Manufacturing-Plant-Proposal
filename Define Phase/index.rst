Process Unit Design: Dehydrogenation reactors for styrene production
====================================================================

The purpose of this report is to find the optimal dimensions and the optimal operating variables
of two dehydrogenation reactors. More specifically, the height and diameter, catalyst amount
and characteristics, heat exchange strategy of reactors need to be determined optimally. The
operating conditions include temperature and pressure as well as the steam-to-ethylbenzene
ratio.

To begin, the design problem has been outlined and general explanations are given for the
presence of the dehydrogenation unit. Specifications, such as single-pass conversion of
ethylbenzene and selectivity to styrene have been made quite clear. The details of all inputs
and outputs of the dehydrogenation reactors, including operating conditions, are demonstrated
in figures and tables. Also, a block diagram of the unit has been used as a visual representation
of the process. Some fundamental high-level decisions, such as reaction sequences, reactor
selection and the type of catalyst, are made with justifications.

Moreover, the design methodology of two reactors is described in details. The design equations
including differential mass balances, energy balances and momentum balances are proposed to
construct the mathematical model. In this report, the heterogeneous model is employed to
include both thermal reactions and catalyst reactions. Since adiabatic reactors are used for the
process, there is no external heat transfer for the individual unit and therefore, the heat transfer
resistance can be neglected. As to mass transfer resistance, calculations demonstrate that it is
also negligible. For the sensitivity of design, the general description of methods has been given.
Furthermore, Wolfram Mathematica 11.1 has been utilised to generate the computational
solutions of the design equations as well as parametric studies. The key variable profiles,
including concentration, pressure, temperature and conversion and selectivity as well, are
presented in this report. Also, results are outlined and used to improve process design. And
based on control scheme and fault tree analysis, some suggestions are proposed for the design.
