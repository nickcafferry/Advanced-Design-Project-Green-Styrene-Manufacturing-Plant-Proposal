The aim of this plant design project is to provide critical insights into and recommendations of the available synthetic routes to styrene along with market, feedstock, economic, and sustainability analyses of the venture. This has culminated in a preliminary overview of the plant design and operation in the area of Ordos, China, produced for our clients at Bentham Corporation. 

About GSM

Company Ethics and Values
------------------------

As a trans-national chemical contracting company operating in a complex and ever-changing world, GSM chemical co. is committed to adhering to the highest of global standards of performance and ethical corporate conduct.The key ethical principles which underpin day-to-day running and company policy of GSM include; Risk management and reduction, professionalism and competence, trust, obligation and liability, organisation and clear communication, regular auditing/review, active whistleblowing, industry regulations, legislation and national/international law, avoidance of conflict of interests as well as social and environmental corporate responsibilities.

Safety Management
-----------------
GSM goes above and beyond to ensure the safety of its employees, contractors as well as others affected by its business activities. GSM, as a UK registered company, follows IEE & CDM regulations and the UK Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) with a particular focus on S2, S3 and S6 of the act; these ensure health and safety of workers, contractors and members of the public is safeguarded. All process equipment is regularly inspected (at minimum biannually) to ensure any faults are repaired/parts replaced and the plant operates safely during start-up, shutdown, normal operation and, so far as reasonably practicable (SFARP) during ‘abnormal operations’.

Employment and Social Responsibility
------------------------------------

GSM co. recognises its corporate responsibility to protect the environment and conserve precious natural resources. The company closely follows the European Industrial Emissions Directive (2010) as well as the DEFRA Environmental Permitting Regulations (2010) from UK legislation. During plant construction and commissioning, great care is taken to ensure the plant is situated in an area which allows minimisation of the environmental impact of our operations. As a company, we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and we ensure all feedstocks, inventories and products/byproducts of our processes are stored, transported and disposed of safely and in accordance with the above legislation.

Energy integration is maximised when designing processes in order to minimise energy consumption and our plant projects are also planned using principles of inherently safe design and passive hazard protection, which reduces the likelihood of occurrence and overall environmental impact of inventory releases, explosions and fires. We also employ recycle streams in process design, use waste products as fuels and find buyers for byproducts/waste effluent streams from our processes wherever economically viable to do so; thereby reducing waste and reducing the consumption of raw materials.

Project Description

Introduction
------------

One of the most important and versatile monomers produced by the chemical industry today is styrene, as shown in Figure 1. While there is no direct end use of styrene, styrene can be easily polymerised to produce a cheap, colourless, lightweight, and stable (thermally & chemically) plastics such as polystyrene, styrene–acrylonitrile and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS), and styrene–butadiene latex. The styrene monomer (SM) exists as a colourless, viscous, aromatic liquid under ambient conditions and can be found naturally, most notably in cinnamon, coffee crops and in coal tar. The impetus for large scale production of styrene was the large demand for styrene–butadiene latex in World War II. After 1946, styrene production became available for the manufacture of a high purity monomer that can be polymerized to produce polystyrene plastics. Since then styrene has had a sustained growth into the 21st century, estimated at almost 6M te/yr in the US alone at around the turn of the century.

The global demand for styrene is growing quickly in response to an increase in demand for thermoplastics, particularly polystyrene. The use of polystyrene is widespread due to the fact that it is the least expensive thermoplastics in terms of cost per volume passes and is easy to polymerize and copolymerise, resulting in plastics with a broad range of characteristics2. With a stable increase in styrene demand, new technological developments have been made to improve the efficiency and decrease the costs of styrene production in major commercial processes. As Bentham Corporation is considering expanding their industrial synthetics commercial activities to the production of SM in Ordos, China, the aim of this report is to propose a process route for the production of styrene of which is required to have a production rate of 100,000 te/yr and a purity of 99.7%. To achieve this, a comparison of different available technologies in the production of styrene will be discussed in order to choose a production method and develop a block flow diagram for the system best suited for the specifications set by Bentham Corporation. Following the selection of the production method, a preliminary process will be developed based on a preliminary mass and energy balance, cost estimation assessment, and potential hazard and mitigation measures that may occur. This process will be simulated on ASPEN to get a detailed insight on the process and identify points of optimization. Finally, the sustainability of overall process based on the final simulation results will be analysed to identify the most sustainable treatments of the waste streams involved in the process.

Process Route Review
-------------------

The conventional method of industrial styrene production is via dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB). This accounts for more than 85% of global styrene production - the remaining 15% is obtained from styrene-propylene oxide (PO) co-production routes. Although the overall profitability of SM production is higher in the PO-SM route than dehydrogenation, the production of styrene is limited by the market demand for propylene oxide (PO) which is 2/10 of that of styrene by weight1,3. With such a limited market for PO, commercial manufacturers of styrene, such as Bentham cooperation, are best served when using an EB dehydrogenation process industrially instead. While EB can be purchased for direct use from suppliers, the most cost-effective route is the production of EB from benzene and ethylene through a catalytically-aided alkylation. The different process route options for both ethylbenzene production and styrene production will now be critically evaluated in order to propose a recommended route of styrene production for Bentham Corporation.
