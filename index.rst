Safety Management
-----------------

GSM goes above and beyond to ensure the safety of its employees, contractors as well as others affected by its business activities. GSM, as a UK registered company, follows IEE & CDM regulations and the UK Health and Safety at Work Act (1974) with a particular focus on S2, S3 and S6 of the act; these ensure health and safety of workers, contractors and members of the public is safeguarded. All process equipment is regularly inspected (at minimum biannually) to ensure any faults are repaired/parts replaced and the plant operates safely during start-up, shutdown, normal operation and, so far as reasonably practicable (SFARP) during ‘abnormal operations’.

GSM organises for H&S according to the 4C’s; CONTROL - clear safety directives, communicated clearly to the ‘hands’ of the organisation from upper management, ensuring personnel understand individual responsibilities and accountabilities; COOPERATION- planning of H&S measures involving workers, management and safety reps, including development of safe systems of work; COMMUNICATION - regular provision of safety information and updates to employees and channels for all employees to voice concerns about safety policy; COMPETANCY - all staff and contractors adequately trained and qualified to ensure job roles can be performed safely.

Auditing and risk assessments are used by GSM to ensure optimal hazard elimination/ risk minimisation and regular safety performance reviews provide a continual basis for performance improvement, as well as facilitating effective management of change.


Employment and Social Responsibility

GSM is committed to attracting, retaining and developing a diverse workforce. When recruiting, GSM co. never discriminates on the basis of gender, age, race, nationality or religion. Regardless of background, all of our employees will have the opportunity to develop their talents and maximise their potential - all while working in an inclusive, meritocratic environment and being recognised and fairly rewarded for their efforts. GSM incorporates positive discrimination when recruiting and promoting employees, including ensuring at least one BAME/disabled and one female candidate is interviewed for each position.

GSM adheres to the Equality Act of 2010, which covers workplace bullying and harassment. All employees have access to HR representatives within the company should they need to make a complaint and employees found guilty of harassment in the workplace will face punitive action; multiple offences will lead to automatic dismissal.
