# Process Route Review
---
The conventional method of industrial styrene production is via dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB). This accounts for more than 85% of global styrene production - the remaining 15% is obtained from styrene-propylene oxide (PO) co-production routes.
Although the overall profitability of SM production is higher in the PO-SM route than dehydrogenation, the production of styrene is limited by the market demand for propylene oxide (PO) which is 2/10 of that of styrene by weight. With such a limited market
for PO, commercial manufacturers of styrene, such as Bentham cooperation, are best served when using an EB dehydrogenation process industrially instead. While EB can be purchased for direct use from suppliers, the most cost-effective route is the production
of EB from benzene and ethylene through a catalytically-aided alkylation. The different process route options for both ethylbenzene production and styrene production will now be critically evaluated in order to propose a recommended route of styrene production 
for Bentham Corporation.
